# HR-Data-Analytics-Employee-Insights-Dashboard
• Scrutinized 3 months (April–June) of employee data from AtliQ Technologies to develop an HR analytics dashboard for tracking workforce insights. 
• Performed data cleaning and transformation in Power Query Editor, creating a reusable template to automate future data updates and maintain a live dashboard. 
• Built an interactive dashboard in PowerBI based on HR requirements, tracking working hours, attendance, performance, and leaves, streamlining HR processes and 
increasing efficiency.  
• The dashboard reduced manual workload by 3-4 hours daily, while revealing insights like higher WFH trends on Fridays and a seasonal rise in WFH during May and 
June for strategic workforce planning.
